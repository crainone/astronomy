## Experimenting with Racket

This code _should_ calculate dates of astronomical events. Even though I used the same calculations as the textbook, the answers keep coming out different. I suspect problems with floating points? I might try starting from the geometry and going step-by-step.

Astronomical events are one of:
1. Vernal equinox (sun at 0 degrees)
2. Summer solstice (.. 90 degrees)
3. Autumnal equinox (... 180 degrees)
4. Winter solstice (... 270 degrees)
